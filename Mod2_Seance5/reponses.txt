Question 2)

nm: list symbols from object files
L'option "-D" : the symbol is in the initialized data section 

objdump: display information from object files
-T (dynamic-syms): Print the dynamic symbol table entries of the file.
           This is only meaningful for dynamic objects, such as
           certain types of shared libraries.  This is similar
           to the information provided by the nm program when
           given the -D (--dynamic) option.
